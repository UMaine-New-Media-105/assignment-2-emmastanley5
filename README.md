For my first assignment I used functions for each of my rows and I also made the colors of my letters functions as well 
for the second assignment I made a triangle with vertex with a light sea green back ground it remined me of a chip in a way 
for my third assignment I used functions to make a lot of them 
for my fourth assignmet part 1 I made the flad of Estonia because it my first name starts with an E and I liked the blue color in the flag 
for the second flad I did sweden because my last name starts with an S and I thought it was pretty cool.
